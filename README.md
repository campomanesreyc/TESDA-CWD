## About Materialize

This project utilizes the Materialize framework for a responsive and visually appealing design. If you're not familiar with Materialize, you can find more information and documentation on the [official website](https://materializecss.com/).

To get started, make sure to include the Materialize CDNJS in your HTML file:

```html
<!-- Compiled and minified CSS -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css"
/>

<!-- Compiled and minified JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script>
```
